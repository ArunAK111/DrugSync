# DrugSync: Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions with Graph Neural Networks

## Overview

DrugSync is a deep learning model designed to predict potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). DDIs can lead to serious adverse effects, especially in patients on chronic medications. DrugSync analyzes molecular structures and historical data to provide accurate predictions, aiding healthcare providers and patients in managing medication regimens.

## Key Features

- **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Model**: Utilizes GNNs to focus on substructure interactions derived from SMILES data, enabling targeted and efficient DDI predictions.
- **State-of-the-Art Technology**: Implements Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to analyze molecular structures, ensuring precise interaction forecasts.
- **Enhanced Patient Safety**: Helps healthcare providers and patients avoid potential adverse drug reactions by predicting DDIs.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Can handle large datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications in healthcare.

## How It Works

DrugSync processes drug molecular structures as graphs, where nodes represent atoms and edges represent bonds. It then applies GNNs to learn and predict potential interactions between drugs. The model is trained on a dataset of known DDIs and evaluated on its ability to correctly predict interactions in unseen drug pairs.
